# Amazon Vine Analysis

Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to review luggage reviews by members of the paid Amazon Vine Program.  Due to the pandemic, travel has been put on hold and people are ready to get some new luggage to finally start traveling again.  I extracted the luggage dataset, transfromed it and connected it to an AWS RDS instance.  After I had created dataframes for customers, products, reviews and the vine data, I was able to upload it into PgAdmin.  Below are snipits validating the data uploaded to PgAdmin.
